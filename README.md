Looking for a job seriously. Not urgent though.

## What can I do?

Mostly web front-end development, including but not limited to: Vanilla JS/CSS/HTML, TypeScript, React, Elm.
Good at functional implementation, accurate modelling, and accessible UI, not good at visually aesthetic design. ("design", the creative process.)

Also some basic back-end/server things, such as basic HTTP server, CLI, and small Linux machine admin.
I usually go with Deno (JS/TS runtime using V8) or Golang. Rust, sometimes.
Comfortable with server-related simple tasks (e.g. SQL, AWS S3/Lambda/CF, systemd), but not with advanced ones (e.g. performance tuning/profiling, CPU-cache-hit-miss-thingy, UNIX socket).
I hate DynamoDB BTW.

Probably unrelated but I have a Prusa i3 MK3S+ (Bear XY/Extruder mod applied, controlled by Klipper & Fluidd) for hobby.

No CS and mathematic background.
You can see lack of those in my code...

## What do I want to do?

Solve a real problem.
Challenging or easy, software or something else, doesn't matter.

## Languages

### Japanese

Native.

### English

Writing and reading? Probably okay, with or without technology.

Talking? Almost no opportunity to use, hence unknown.
However I need to turn on CC for TV shows/movies on Netflix, so I guess there are still many hurdles I have to kick out.

I may make a catastrophic grammatical mistake or nonsense in my issue comments, documents, or source code.
Corrections (Pull Requests) are very appriciated.
